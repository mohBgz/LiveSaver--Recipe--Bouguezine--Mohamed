                Cooking (star emoji)
                in 2 Steps
     

### Fisrt Step : Cooking the Pasta
(Ezzzz you'll see)

    1- fill the half of you're casrona with watter and add some zit to it and let it boils
    2- when it's done drop your Pasta and let it cook
    3-you can easaly check if it's done cooking or not
    4 - if it's the case the next step is to tsafiha from water u will need a kaskas for that , it's better to tchalahlha at the same time
    5- your Pasta is good to go ! 

### Second  Step : Cooking the Pasta

> ___Almost there_ . . .__ 

    __Our goal here is to prepare 'sauce like' to add the extra taste to our Pasta

    let's get started ...

    
    1- slice Tomato , Onion , Tourchi, into square sahpe peices not too big or too small  .

    3- get youre ma9la under a calm fire,  put there somme zit ,let it yaskhone a bit and then add onoin fisrt  

    3 - wait for it a little bit (20 seconds) and then add tomatos & tourchi 

    4 - add some esipece & salt
          *felel k7al 
                "basically it's the darkest one between all of them"
                
          * kamoune
                " it's brown like color he have like small khachbat in it "   

          * ras al7anout 
             "this one is tricky , just pick a yellow/orange one and put it there.
             you need  trust me on this i can't tell you exactly how it feels or how it looks like cuz there are a lot of yellow ones and they all look the same , you'll need some experince for this xD
             "
          

1- Now you can increase the fire (closer to meduim ) 

2- It's prefered to cover youre ma9la with some ghtiwa to faster to coocking process 

when it's done coocking ... 

>## Congratulations big Chef !
